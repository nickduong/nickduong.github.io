    <h1>The Wonders of Ocean Life (Climate Change)</h1>

    <p>
        Life in the Arctic and Southern Oceans thrives despite <strong>extreme conditions</strong>, but climate change is disrupting the ecosystems. 
        The loss of sea ice <strong>harms</strong> species like polar bears, walruses, and pteropods.
        Communities that are near the poles face <strong>coastal erosion</strong>, <strong>permafrost</strong>, and <strong>forced relocations</strong> due to the changes in the environment.
